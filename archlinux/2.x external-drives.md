# Adding other mount points

# Prerequisites
- Required packages:  
  `ntfs-3g`

# Process
## Step 1: Identify the drives
Use `lsblk -f` to see the drive details and the UUIDs

## Step 2: Make new folders
Here make a new folder for each drive in `/mnt`. Use `/media` for removable drives.

`cd /mnt` to goto the location

`mkdir [FOLDER_NAME]` to make directories

## Step 3: Mapping drives in fstab
Open the file `/etc/fstab` in your editor

Map each drive in a line in the following format
`UUID=[UUID_FROM_STEP_1]  [MOUNT_POINT_FROM_SETP_2]  [FILE_TYPE]  [PERMISSIONS]  [DEPT] [PASS]`
Example: 
`UUID=123456  /mnt/mydrive  ntfs  defaults  0 0`

## Step 4: Reboot
