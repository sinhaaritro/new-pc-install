# Creating new users and groups
1. Create a user named aritro by `useradd -m -G wheel aritro`
2. Change aritro's password by `passwd aritro`
## Editing when password is needed by pacman
Here `vi` is always needed. You need to run `visudo`
1. Run the command `EDITOR=nvim visudo /etc/sudoers`
2. Find the **User privilege specification** section. Can use search
3. Uncomment the line `# %wheel  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
4. `:wq` to save and quit

You can add the following line to let people run some commands without sudo
```bash
## Allow wheel members to run some commands without a password
# %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/shutdown,/usr/bin/reboot,/usr/bin/pacman -Syu,/usr/bin/pacman -Syyu,/usr/bin/pacman -Rns
```
