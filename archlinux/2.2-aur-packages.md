# Install AUR package
Make sure `git` and `base-devel` packages are installed
## Without AUR Helper
### Making package
1. Search the package from https://aur.archlinux.org/
2. Copy its **Git Clone URL**
3. Goto a repo folder and run `git clone [GIT URL FROM STEP 2]`
4. Go in the folder `cd [PACKAGE NAME]`
5. Run `makepkg -s` to make the package. This will create a .pkg.tar.zst file
6. Run `sudo pacman -U [FILE NAME FROM STEP 5]`

Alternatively, in step 5 we can write `makepkg -si`. Here `s` will get all dependencies, and `i` will also install the file (no need for step 6)
### Upgrading package
1. Goto repo folder and run `git pull`
2. Do steps 5 and 6 of Install AUR helper
## With AUR Helper
AUR helpers automate the process of building packages. But it is better to build the package manually.

Here lets use yay.
### Install yay
1. Create a new folder `mkdir aurpackage`
2. Go inside `aurpackage` by `cd aurpackage`
3. Get the yay package by `git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git`
4. Go inside the directory by `cd yay`
5. Create package by `makepkg -si`
### Install new package
1. Search for package with the name like `yay ttf-maple`
2. If multiple packages are found select the number corresponding to the  package
3. Select `N` for Clean build option. If package fails to work then do a Clean build by `A`
4. Press `Y` where needed
### Upgrade package
`yay -Syu` will update all packages of pacman and PKGBUILD
### Remove package
