# Process
## Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys
1. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.ssh
   ```
2. Look for files named `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`. If they exist, you already have an SSH key pair.

---

## Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key
If no SSH keys exist or you want to create a new pair:

1. Run the following command, replacing `your_email@example.com` with your GitHub email:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   > If your system doesn't support Ed25519, use `rsa` instead:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press `Enter` to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).

3. If prompted for a passphrase, you can add one for extra security or press `Enter` for no passphrase.

---

## Step 3: Add the SSH Key to the SSH Agent

1. Start the SSH agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```
2. Add your SSH key to the agent:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```
   Replace `id_ed25519` with the appropriate file name if you used a different algorithm or key name.

---

## Step 4: **Add the SSH Key to GitHub**


1. Copy your SSH public key to the clipboard:
   ```bash
   xclip -sel clip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   If `xclip` is not installed, use:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```
   Then manually copy the output.

2. Log in to your GitHub account via the website.

3. Go to **Settings > SSH and GPG keys**.

4. Click **New SSH Key**.

5. Paste your public key into the "Key" field, give it a title, and click **Add SSH Key**.

---

## Step 5: **Test the SSH Connection**

1. In your terminal, run:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```
2. You should see a message like:
   ```
   Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
   ```

## Optional/Extra Steps for Better Functionality

- **Use Multiple SSH Keys (if needed):**
  If you have multiple GitHub accounts or other services using SSH keys, create a `~/.ssh/config` file:
  ```bash
  touch ~/.ssh/config
  ```
  Add the following configuration:
  ```text
  Host github.com
      HostName github.com
      User git
      IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
  ```

- **Backup SSH Keys:**
  Save your `~/.ssh` directory securely (e.g., on an encrypted USB drive).

- **Install GUI Tools:**
  Tools like `seahorse` or `gpg-agent` can help manage keys more conveniently.

- **Keep Your System Updated:**
  Regularly update Arch Linux to ensure compatibility and security:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -Syu
  ```
